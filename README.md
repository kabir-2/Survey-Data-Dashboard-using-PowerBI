# Survey-Data-Dashboard-using-PowerBI

Objective: Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing survey data.<br>

Project Steps:<br>

1. Data Integration: Consolidate survey data from diverse sources (CSV, Excel, databases), ensuring data quality.<br>

2. Modeling: Build a robust data model, establish relationships, and create necessary calculations for insights.<br>

3. Dashboard Design: Choose key metrics and KPIs, use effective visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs), and implement interactivity with filters and slicers.<br>

4. Insights: Analyze survey trends, patterns, and correlations, leveraging segmentation for deeper insights.<br>

5. Deployment: Publish securely on Power BI Service, manage permissions, and schedule data refreshes.<br>

6. Feedback and Maintenance: Gather user feedback for iterative improvements, monitor dashboard performance, and update as needed.<br>

This project aims to deliver a powerful tool for survey data analysis, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on comprehensive insights.<br>
